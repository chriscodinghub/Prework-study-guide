Boot Camp Prework Study Guide for Students

## Description


I built this website to kick off my new career field. This project to assist me in learning the basics of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. It allows for me to add notes for each section listed as I progress through my boot camp. This project both created and solved many problems that I ran into along the way, some of the most frustrating portions being my SSH key had a password on it which was causing my git push to fail, that then caused me to have duplicate prework-study-guide folders within my user drive somehow. I solved this by renewing a new SSH key. Then I had to go into my files and delete the duplicate folder. At this point everything went smoothly. I learned so much from this project, from the simple structuring of HTML, the link which allows CSS and JS to both funtion within the HTML but on seperate code lines, the basic concepts of CSS and JS which is just barely scratching the surface.



## Usage

This program is designed for me to intigrate my knowledge of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript into one project and to be able to add notes within each subsection.

## Credits

I worked on this project alone.
